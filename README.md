# ring-benchmark-rs

This is my solution for the exercise in ["Programming in Erlang"](http://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang/programming-erlang):

> Write a ring benchmark. Create N processes in a ring. Send a message round the ring M times so that a total of N * M messages get sent.
> Time how long this takes for different values of N and M. 

It is also an experiment and an excuse to play with async in Rustlang.
